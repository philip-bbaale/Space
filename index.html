                <h3>Why would you attend the Skynet Space School?</h3>
                <p>Engineering and technology play a large part in all our lives and in the economy of Scotland. The Scottish Space School seeks to inspire the next generation to pursue engineering related courses of study, and consider careers in engineering and technology.</p>
                <p>The summer school programme is an opportunity for the pupils who attend to participate in a number of engineering-based activities, all of which are aimed at increasing the awareness of engineering and the career opportunities available. </p>
                <p>It is a one week residential programme run by the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Strathclyde. Each year 100 S5 pupils from schools all over Scotland attend the programme and stay on the University campus for the week.</p>
                <h3>The History</h3>
                <p>Since its inception in 2002 over 1800 pupils from high schools across Scotland have taken part in the Scottish Space School, with over 900 now employed in well paid jobs with prospects in science and technology.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6 about_sch1">
                <h3>The Programme</h3>
                <p>The current programme comprises a week long residential summer school with an eclectic mix of lectures, labs and workshops all on a space theme, delivered by leading academics and researchers, and supported by NASA astronauts and engineers. The NASA guests join the students in selected activities and engage with them in small group and one-to-one discussions with the explicit aim of inspiring the next generation of engineers. Over thirty astronauts and cosmonauts have addressed the students at Space School in this university over the past ten years, some of them on more than one occasion. </p>
                <h3>Learning Journey</h3>
                <p>During the Space School week, staff and mentors assess the pupils on the basis of their performance on the allocated tasks and activities, their skills both as a team leader and a team player, and their general attitude, and 40 are then invited to attend a selection workshop. Following a rigorous assessment process 8 pupils are then chosen to go on a learning journey to Houston, Texas.</p>
                <p>The Learning Journey is a once in a lifetime opportunity for the selected pupils.</p>

                <p>In todayâ€™s ever-advancing world, we are living at the speed of science. The pace of change in society over the next 30 years will outpace the change we have experienced in the last five thousand years.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An expected 50% of current jobs will disappear;</li>
                    <li>Over 50% of jobs in the next 20 years do not exist today;</li>
                    <li>75% of the fastest growing occupations require STEAM-related skills.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Students can be at the forefront of this exciting era. These students will have an average of four careers and 17 different jobs in their lifetime. It is so important that they learn and master critical transportable skills to successfully navigate the fast-changing landscape shaped by automation, robotic, artificial intelligence, globalisation and collaboration. Empowered with the critical STEAM related skills set, students will not only become the capable and competitive job seekers, most importantly, they will become the innovative job creators.</p>
